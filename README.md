_NOTE: To allow the Adyen Drop-In and Components to load, you have to add gitpod.io as allowed origin for your chosen set of [API Credentials](https://ca-test.adyen.com/ca/ca/config/api_credentials_new.shtml)_

## Details

This repository includes examples of PCI-compliant UI integrations for online payments with Adyen. Within this demo app, you'll find a simplified version of an e-commerce website, complete with commented code to highlight key features and concepts of Adyen's API. Check out the underlying code to see how you can integrate Adyen to give your shoppers the option to pay with their preferred payment methods, all in a seamless checkout experience.

## Requirements

-   Java 11
-   Network access to maven central

## Installation

1. Clone this repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/adyen-examples/adyen-java-spring-online-payments.git
```

## Usage

1. Set environment variables for the required configuration
    - [API key](https://docs.adyen.com/user-management/how-to-get-the-api-key)
    - [Client Key](https://docs.adyen.com/user-management/client-side-authentication)
    - [Merchant Account](https://docs.adyen.com/account/account-structure)
    - [HMAC Key](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/webhooks/verify-hmac-signatures)

Remember to include `http://localhost:8080` in the list of Allowed Origins

On Linux/Mac export env variables
```shell
export ADYEN_API_KEY=yourAdyenApiKey
export ADYEN_MERCHANT_ACCOUNT=yourAdyenMerchantAccount
export ADYEN_CLIENT_KEY=yourAdyenClientKey
export ADYEN_HMAC_KEY=yourHmacKey
```

On Windows CMD you can use below commands instead
```shell
set ADYEN_API_KEY=yourAdyenApiKey
set ADYEN_MERCHANT_ACCOUNT=yourAdyenMerchantAccount
set ADYEN_CLIENT_KEY=yourAdyenClientKey
set ADYEN_HMAC_KEY=yourHmacKey
```

Alternatively it is possible to define the settings in the `application.properties`
```# application.properties
ADYEN_API_KEY=yourAdyenApiKey
ADYEN_MERCHANT_ACCOUNT=yourAdyenMerchantAccount
ADYEN_CLIENT_KEY=yourAdyenClientKey
ADYEN_HMAC_KEY=yourHmacKey
```
2. Start the server:

```
./gradlew bootRun
```

3. Visit [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) to select an integration type.

To try out integrations with test card numbers and payment method details, see [Test card numbers](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/test-cards/test-card-numbers).

## Testing webhooks

This demo provides a simple webhook integration at `/api/webhooks/notifications`. You will need to:

* Make sure Adyen's server is able to reach you application
* Define a standard webhook in your Customer Area


### Making your server reachable

Your application runs on the cloud: this is normally enough (your server accepts incoming requests)

Your application runs on your local machine: you need to use a service like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to "tunnel" the webhook notifications.

Once you have set up ngrok, make sure to add the provided ngrok URL to the list of **Allowed Origins** in the “API Credentials" of your Customer Area.

### Setting up a webhook

* In the “Developers" -> “Webhooks" section create a new ‘Standard notification' webhook.
* In “Additional Settings” section configure (if necessary) the additional data you want to receive (i.e. 'Payment Account Reference’).

That's it! Every time you perform a payment method, your server will receive a notification from Adyen's server.

You can find more information in the [Webhooks documentation](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/webhooks) and in [this blog post](https://www.adyen.com/blog/Integrating-webhooks-notifications-with-Adyen-Checkout).

## Deploying this example to the cloud

As part of this example, we are providing a [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) configuration file that can be used to deploy this demo to the Amazon cloud on a [Beanstalk](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/) environment.

 ⚠️ This part will deploy (AWS) cloud resources and can incur charges ⚠️.


### Extra prerequisites

* The [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html), with a configured profile (and an AWS account).
* The [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) CLI, with the `terraform` executable in your PATH.
* Ready to use Adyen API and client keys.

### Usage

* Compile the project: `./gradlew build`
* Create a `terraform.tfvars` file in the root directory of this repository. Here is a example :

```
adyen_api_key = "testApiKey"
adyen_merchant_account = "testMerchantAccount"
adyen_client_key = "testClientKey"
adyen_hmac_key = "testHMACKey"
```

* Run the `terraform init` command to initialize the Terraform configuration, and `terraform apply` to deploy the environment.
* At the end of the deployment, Terraform will output several URLs :

```
adyen_url = "https://ca-test.adyen.com/ca/ca/config/showthirdparty.shtml"
demo_url = "http://adyen-spring-development-cc66dd5f.eu-west-1.elasticbeanstalk.com"
environment_url = "https://eu-west-1.console.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/home?region=eu-west-1#/applications"
```

* You can access the demo using the `demo_url`.
* The `adyen_url` can be used to create a [notification webhook](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/webhooks) in the Adyen customer area.
* Use `terraform destroy` to remove the environment and avoid being charged for the resources more than necessary.
* The `environment_url` can be used to access the AWS Beanstalk environment and possibly update the configuration.
