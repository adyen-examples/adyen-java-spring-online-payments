## Run this integration in seconds using [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/)

* Open your [Adyen Test Account](https://ca-test.adyen.com/ca/ca/overview/default.shtml) and create a set of [API keys](https://docs.adyen.com/user-management/how-to-get-the-api-key).
* Go to [gitpod account variables](https://gitpod.io/variables).
* Set the `ADYEN_API_KEY`, `ADYEN_CLIENT_KEY`, `ADYEN_HMAC_KEY` and `ADYEN_MERCHANT_ACCOUNT` variables.
* Click the button below!

_NOTE: To allow the Adyen Drop-In and Components to load, you have to add `https://*.gitpod.io` as allowed origin for your chosen set of [API Credentials](https://ca-test.adyen.com/ca/ca/config/api_credentials_new.shtml)_

## Details

This is a sample designed to demonstrate the Adyen Giving donations workflow.
First make a test payment using one of our test card numbers, so you can see the donation screen appear.

> **Note**: You need to have donations [enabled in your Customer Area](https://docs.adyen.com/online-payments/donations/testing/#step-1-enable-the-donation-token-in-your-api-response) in order to receive the `DonationToken`.

## Supported Integrations

The amount of payment methods supported for donations is limited. In this demo, you will find a use case centered around the use of cards. 
The Demo leverages Adyen's API Library for Java ([GitHub](https://github.com/Adyen/adyen-java-api-library) | [Docs](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/libraries?tab=java_2#java)).

## Requirements

-   Java 17
-   Network access to maven central

## Installation

1. Clone this repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/adyen-examples/adyen-java-spring-online-payments.git
```

## Usage

1. Set environment variables for the required configuration
    - [API key](https://docs.adyen.com/user-management/how-to-get-the-api-key)
    - [Client Key](https://docs.adyen.com/user-management/client-side-authentication)
    - [Merchant Account](https://docs.adyen.com/account/account-structure)
    - [HMAC Key](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/webhooks/verify-hmac-signatures)

Remember to include `http://localhost:8080` in the list of Allowed Origins

On Linux/Mac export env variables
```shell
export ADYEN_API_KEY=yourAdyenApiKey
export ADYEN_MERCHANT_ACCOUNT=yourAdyenMerchantAccount
export ADYEN_CLIENT_KEY=yourAdyenClientKey
export ADYEN_HMAC_KEY=yourHmacKey
```

On Windows CMD you can use below commands instead
```shell
set ADYEN_API_KEY=yourAdyenApiKey
set ADYEN_MERCHANT_ACCOUNT=yourAdyenMerchantAccount
set ADYEN_CLIENT_KEY=yourAdyenClientKey
set ADYEN_HMAC_KEY=yourHmacKey
```

Alternatively it is possible to define the settings in the `application.properties`
```# application.properties
ADYEN_API_KEY=yourAdyenApiKey
ADYEN_MERCHANT_ACCOUNT=yourAdyenMerchantAccount
ADYEN_CLIENT_KEY=yourAdyenClientKey
ADYEN_HMAC_KEY=yourHmacKey
```
2. Start the server:

```
./gradlew bootRun
```

3. Visit [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) pick the Card component integration, follow the instructions, and after the payment you will be offered to make a donation.

To try out this application with test card numbers, visit [Test card numbers](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/test-cards/test-card-numbers).
We recommend saving some test cards in your browser so you can test your integration faster in the future.

## Testing webhooks

Webhooks deliver asynchronous notifications and it is important to test them during the setup of your integration. You can find more information about webhooks in [this detailed blog post](https://www.adyen.com/blog/Integrating-webhooks-notifications-with-Adyen-Checkout).

This sample application provides two webhook integrations exposed at `/api/webhooks/notifications` and `/api/webhooks/giving`, respectively to receive payment notifications and donation notifications. For it to work, you need to:

1. Provide a way for the Adyen platform to reach your running application
2. Add a Standard webhook in your Customer Area

### Making your server reachable

Your endpoint that will consume the incoming webhook must be publicly accessible.

There are typically 3 options:
* deploy on your own cloud provider
* deploy on Gitpod
* expose your localhost with tunneling software (i.e. ngrok)

#### Option 1: cloud deployment
If you deploy on your cloud provider (or your own public server) the webhook URLs will be the URL of the server 
```
  https://{cloud-provider}/api/webhooks/notifications
  https://{cloud-provider}/api/webhooks/giving
```

#### Option 2: Gitpod
If you use Gitpod the webhook URL will be the host assigned by Gitpod
```
  https://myorg-myrepo-y8ad7pso0w5.ws-eu75.gitpod.io/api/webhooks/notifications
  https://myorg-myrepo-y8ad7pso0w5.ws-eu75.gitpod.io/api/webhooks/giving
```
**Note:** when starting a new Gitpod workspace the host changes, make sure to **update the Webhook URL** in the Customer Area

#### Option 3: localhost via tunneling software
If you use a tunneling service like [ngrok](ngrok) the webhook URL will be the generated URL (ie `https://c991-80-113-16-28.ngrok.io`)

```bash
  $ ngrok http 8080
  
  Session Status                online                                                                                           
  Account                       ############                                                                      
  Version                       #########                                                                                          
  Region                        United States (us)                                                                                 
  Forwarding                    http://c991-80-113-16-28.ngrok.io -> http://localhost:8080                                       
  Forwarding                    https://c991-80-113-16-28.ngrok.io -> http://localhost:8080           
```

**Note:** when restarting ngrok a new URL is generated, make sure to **update the Webhook URL** in the Customer Area

### Set up a webhook

* In the Customer Area go to Developers -> Webhooks and create a new 'Standard notification' webhook.
* Enter the URL of your application/endpoint (see options [above](#making-your-server-reachable))
* Define username and password for Basic Authentication
* Generate the HMAC Key
* Optionally, in Additional Settings, add the data you want to receive. A good example is 'Payment Account Reference'.
* Make sure the webhook is **Enabled** (therefore it can receive the notifications)

That's it! Every time you perform a new payment, your application will receive a notification from the Adyen platform.
